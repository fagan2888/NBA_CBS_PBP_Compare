## Summary

This project is a working demo that compares two different NBA Play-by-play logs. The two sets come from NBA.com and CBSSports.com. At this point, this project compares Jump Shots, Rebounds, Layups, and Dunks. 

## How to use

Since this is not complete, polished product, to input the two Play-by-play logs simply update the cbsLink and nbaLink variables within Compare.java, and run. To see the ouput after you have ran the code, look in the working folder for a file name compareResults_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.html

## Example

To see an example output, open up the compareResults.html page in the main directory.
